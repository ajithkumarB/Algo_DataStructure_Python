# Context: A semiprime is a product of two prime
# numbers, not necessarily distinct.
# Squares of prime numbers are also semiprimes.

# Problem: Find the numbers which are semiprimes,
# within a given range. For e.g. 1 to 100.

def isSemiprime(num):
  # start with the smallest prime
  prime = 2
  # initialize counter to 0
  count = 0
  # Design of while loop:
  # 1. if count exceeds 2, it is not a semiprime, e.g. 30 = 2*3*5
  # 2. when the number becomes 1, we have found the second prime
  while(count<3 and num!=1):
    # if the number is divisible by current prime,
    # increment count, else move to new prime
    if(not(num % prime)):
      num = num / prime
      count=count+1
    else:
      prime = prime + 1
  # if count is two, given number is a semiprime
  return count == 2
  
for i in range(1,100):
  if(isSemiprime(i)):
    print(i, end=' ')
    
# Result: 4 6 9 10 14 15 21 22 25 26 33 34 35 38 39 46 49 
# 51 55 57 58 62 65 69 74 77 82 85 86 87 91 93 94 95
